//   Account Book 
// The FCC (Foundation for Combating Corruption) dismantled a major corruption 
// scheme in Nlogonia. During the operation, several account books, with notes 
// documenting the illicit transactions carried out by the scheme, were seized 
// by FCC agents.
// Each page on the account books contains some transactions (income or expense, 
// in nilogos, the local currency of Nlog√¥nia, whose symbol is N$) and the cash 
// flow resulting from transaco tions on that page. For example, if a page 
// recorded the following transactions: an income of N$ 7, an income of N$ 2, 
// an expense of N$ 3, an income of N$ 1 and an expense of N$ 11, the cash flow 
// on that page would be 7 + 2 - 3 + 1 - 11 = -4.
// 
// However, to obstruct the work of the police, the offenders did not record
//  in their account books the type of each transaction (income or expense). 
// In the example above, the page would contain only the numbers 7, 2, 3, 1 
// and 11 (with no indication whether they were income or expense 
// transactions). The cash flow for each page, however, was always recorded 
// normally, with the signal (in this case, -4).
// 
// To guarantee that the offenders are convicted, prosecutors must be able to 
// determine with certainty whether each transaction is an income or an 
// expense. In the example above, transaction N$ 7 was certainly an income, 
// and transaction N$ 11 was certainly an expense. But we cannot say anything 
// about transactions N$ 2, N$ 3, and N$ 1. Transactions N$ 2 and N$ 1 could 
// have been income and in this case transaction N$ 3 would have been an 
// expense; or N$ 1 and N$ 2 could have been expenses and in this case 
// transaction N$ 3 would be an income.
// 
// Many account books have a relatively large number of pages, with many 
// transactions, making it is difficult for the police to process all the 
// information. Therefore, they need a program that performs the task
//  efficiently.
// 
// Input 
// 
// The input consists of several test cases. The first line of a test case 
// contains two integers N and F, indicating the number of transactions on 
// the page ( 2N40) and cash flow for this page ( -16000F16000). Each of the 
// following N lines contains an integer Ti indicating the value of the i-th 
// transaction ( 1Ti1000).
// The last test case is followed by a line containing only two numbers zero 
// separated by a space.
// 
// Output 
// 
// For each test case the input your program must print a single line with N 
// characters. The i-th character must be `+', if it is possible determine 
// with certainty that the i-th transaction is an income, `-', if it is 
// possible to determine with certainty that the i-th operation is an expense, 
// and `?', if it is impossible to determine with certainty the type of 
// transaction. If the cash flow recorded in the page cannot be obtained from 
// the transactions recorded in the page, your program must print a single 
// line containing the character `*'.
// Sample Input 
// 
// 5 7
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
// 4 15
// 3
// 5
// 7
// 11
// 5 12
// 6
// 7
// 7
// 1
// 7
// 0 0
// Sample Output
