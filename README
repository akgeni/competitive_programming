This is a project repo for all my competitive programming. Majority of the problems I solve are from UVa, CodeChef, interviewstreet and project euler. Although I've not solved problem in project euler for a year now.

I have two templates in the directory "Templates" - one for c++ and one for python - which provide as a starting point for solving a problem.
