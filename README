Contains all my projecteuler.net solutions.

Update Sep 08 2011

In this project I'm solving the problems from projecteuler.net. The problems 
from 1 - 67 have been moved to a directory. I'll be putting new solutions into 
their own folders from now on. Till now using C programming design style (i've 
used generic functions sometimes though); from now on I'll be trying out object 
oriented design.
